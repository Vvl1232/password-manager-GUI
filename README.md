# Password Manager 🛡️🔐

I created a password manager using Python and Tkinter. It includes:
Password Generation: Generates secure passwords with letters, numbers, and symbols.
Save Password: Allows saving passwords to a file after confirmation.
User Interface: Clean UI using Tkinter, with labeled fields for website, email/username, and password. 🎨
